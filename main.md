# Hypotheses Testing

## Steps for Hypotheses Testing

In a court of law, there are 2 possible errors: 1. Finding the defendant
guilty when he is innocent. 2. Finding the defendant innocent when he is
guilty.

In hypothesis testing, these 2 types of errors translate as follows:

1.  **Type I error**: The mistake of rejecting the null hypothesis when
    it is true. For instance, in the above example, rejecting the
    hypothesis of mean salary being \$45,000 when, in fact, it is true.
2.  **Type II error**: The mistake of failing to reject the null
    hypothesis when it is false. For instance, in the above example,
    failing to reject the hypothesis of mean salary being \$45,000 when,
    in reality, it is not true.

### In Conclusion

#### Type I and II Errors:

The size of $\alpha$, the rejection region, affects the risk of making
different types of incorrect decisions.

- **Type I Error**:
  - Rejecting a true null hypothesis when it should NOT be rejected.
  - Considered a serious type of error.
  - The probability of Type I Error is $\alpha$.
  - It is also called the level of significance of the test.
- **Type II Error**:
  - Failing to reject a false null hypothesis that should have been
    rejected.
  - The probability of Type II Error is $\beta$.
