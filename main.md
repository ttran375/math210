# Math 210 â€“ Assignment 1 B (Statistics)

1\. For the data below, representing a sample of heights (in metres) for
10 years old males at a certain school, find:

Data: 1.3, 1.5, 1.4, 1.3, 1.2, 1.4 **\[8 marks\]**

1)  The mean

b\) The median

c\) The mode

d\) The standard deviation

e\) The 72<sup>nd</sup> percentile

**Solve by hand (without the use of software) and include full
solutions.**

### a) Mean

$$
\begin{align}
\bar{x}
&= \dfrac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}x_i}{n} \\
&= \dfrac{1.3 + 1.5 + 1.4 + 1.3 + 1.2 + 1.4}{6} \\
&= 1.35
\end{align}
$$

### b) Median

Data in ascending order: 1.2, 1.3, 1.3, 1.4, 1.4, 1.5

Since there are 6 data points (even number), the median is the average
of the 3rd and 4th values:

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Median}
&= \frac{1.3 + 1.4}{2} \\
&= 1.35
\end{align}
$$

### c) Mode

Data frequencies:

- 1.2: 1 time
- 1.3: 2 times
- 1.4: 2 times
- 1.5: 1 time

Both 1.3 and 1.4 appear twice, so there are two modes: 1.3 and 1.4
