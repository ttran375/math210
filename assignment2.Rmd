# Math 210 – Assignment 2 B (Statistics)

## Question 1

At a certain college, 3% of students do not use the college Gym. If
    a random sample of 12 students is selected, calculate: ***Express
    your answers correct to 4 decimal places.***

<!-- -->

a\) The probability that exactly 3 of them will not use the college Gym. [3 marks]

b\) At least 2 will not use the college Gym. [4 marks]

c\) The mean for the probability distribution [1 mark]

d\) The standard deviation for the probability distribution [1 mark]

<!-- -->

$$ P(X = k) = C_{n}^{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} $$

### a) The probability that exactly 3 of them will not use the college Gym. [3 marks]

$$ P(X = 3) = C_{12}^{3} (0.03)^3 (0.97)^9 \approx 0.0045 $$

### b) At least 2 will not use the college Gym. [4 marks]

$$
\begin{align}
P(X \geq 2) &= 1 - P(X < 2) \\
&= 1 - [P(X = 0) + P(X = 1)] \\
&= 1 - [ C_{12}^{0} (0.03)^0 (0.97)^{12} + C_{12}^{1} (0.03)^1 (0.97)^{11} ] \\
&\approx 0.0579
\end{align}
$$

### c) The mean for the probability distribution

$$ \mu = n \cdot p = 12 \times 0.03 = 0.36 $$

### d) The standard deviation for the probability distribution

$$ \sigma = \sqrt{n \cdot p \cdot (1 - p)} = \sqrt{12 \times 0.03 \times 0.97} \approx 0.5910 $$

## Question 2

The weights of 12 months old Siamese cats is known to be normally distributed with a mean of 7.2 lbs and a standard deviation of 1.4 lbs.

<!-- -->

a\) If a Siamese cat is selected at random, what is the probability of
    having a weight greater than 7.5 lbs? [3 marks]

b\) If a sample of 25 Siamese cats is selected, what is the probability
    that their mean weight is between 6.8 lbs and 7.3 lbs? [4 marks]

<!-- -->

### a) The probability of a randomly selected Siamese cat weighing more than 7.5 lbs

To find this probability, we first calculate the Z-score for 7.5 lbs.

The Z-score formula is:

\[ Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \]

Where:
- \( X \) = 7.5 lbs
- \( \mu \) = 7.2 lbs
- \( \sigma \) = 1.4 lbs

\[ Z = \frac{7.5 - 7.2}{1.4} \]

\[ Z = \frac{0.3}{1.4} \]

\[ Z \approx 0.2143 \]

Next, we look up this Z-score in the standard normal distribution table, or use a calculator to find the probability associated with this Z-score. The table or calculator gives the probability that a value is less than 7.5 lbs.

Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator:

\[ P(Z < 0.2143) \approx 0.5856 \]

The probability of a value being greater than 7.5 lbs is the complement:

\[ P(X > 7.5) = 1 - P(Z < 0.2143) \]

\[ P(X > 7.5) = 1 - 0.5856 \]

\[ P(X > 7.5) \approx 0.4144 \]

So, the probability of a randomly selected Siamese cat weighing more than 7.5 lbs is approximately **0.4144**.

## Question 3

Find the following **probabilities**. Provide a graph for each case. [9 marks]

<!-- -->

a\) *P*(−1.23 \< *z* \< 1.15)

b\) *P*(*z* \> 0.78)

c\) *P*(*z* \< 3.10)

## Question 4

A high school wants to estimate the average number of hours per week
their students spend playing sports. They randomly select a sample
of 25 students and record the number of hours each student spends
playing sports. The sample has a mean of 4.5 hours per week with a
standard deviation of 1.1 hours per week. Considering a normal
distribution, construct a 90% confidence interval for the mean
number of hours per week that the students at the high school spend
playing sports.

<!-- -->

a\) Find the margin of error [2 marks]

b\) Find the confidence interval for the population mean [2 marks]

## Question 5

A software development team is assessing the performance of a new
feature in a software application. They collected data from a sample
of 35 users and recorded the time (in seconds) it took for each user
to complete a specific task. The sample mean completion time was 25
seconds. It is known that the population standard deviation of
completion time is 3.2 seconds. Calculate a 99% confidence interval
for the true mean completion time of all users.

a\) Find the best point estimate for the population mean [1 mark]

b\) Find the critical value [1 mark]

c\) Find the margin of error (maximum error of estimate) [2 marks]

d\) Find the confidence interval [2 mark]
