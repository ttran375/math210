1.  The class width

2.  The number of participants in the study

3.  The class boundaries for the **second class**

4.  The relative frequency for the **fourth class**

**Solve by hand (without the use of software) and include full
solutions.**

3\. The following data represents the ages for a sample of people
swimming at a community centre pool:

4, 20, 23, 7, 23, 17, 27, 28, 47, 49, 23, 18, 34, 43

1.  What is the interquartile range? **\[3 marks\]**

2.  Are there any outliers in the data? Perform all necessary
    calculations to justify your answer. Use the method involving the
    interquartile range to identify the outliers (specify if they are
    mild or severe). **\[3 marks\]**

**Solve by hand (without the use of software) and include full
solutions.**

a\) The z – score for a grade of 95%. **\[2 marks\]**

b\) What is the grade positioned 2.0 standard deviations below the
mean? **\[2 marks\]**

**Solve by hand (without the use of software) and include full
solutions.**

5\. For the bivariate data below:

| X   | Y   |
|-----|-----|
| 3   | 15  |
| 9   | 21  |
| 12  | 30  |
| 13  | 33  |
| 17  | 42  |
| 21  | 56  |

descriptive statistics (at least 3 measures of central tendency, 2
measures of dispersion and all quartiles) for the following data set,
representing the number of minutes needed to solve a certain statistics
problem by a sample of 20 students:

2.1 2.3 4.7 7.9 5.5 6.6 6.4 12.4 6.8 12.5 9.3 8.3 12.7 3.8 11.2 11.2
