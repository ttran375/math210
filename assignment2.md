# Math 210 – Assignment 2 B (Statistics)

## Question 1

At a certain college, 3% of students do not use the college Gym. If
    a random sample of 12 students is selected, calculate: ***Express
    your answers correct to 4 decimal places.***

<!-- -->

a\) The probability that exactly 3 of them will not use the college Gym. [3 marks]

b\) At least 2 will not use the college Gym. [4 marks]

c\) The mean for the probability distribution [1 mark]

d\) The standard deviation for the probability distribution [1 mark]

<!-- -->

## Question 2

The weights of 12 months old Siamese cats is known to be normally distributed with a mean of 7.2 lbs and a standard deviation of 1.4 lbs.

<!-- -->

a\) If a Siamese cat is selected at random, what is the probability of
    having a weight greater than 7.5 lbs? [3 marks]

b\) If a sample of 25 Siamese cats is selected, what is the probability
    that their mean weight is between 6.8 lbs and 7.3 lbs? [4 marks]

<!-- -->

## Question 3

Find the following **probabilities**. Provide a graph for each case. [9 marks]

<!-- -->

a\) *P*(−1.23 \< *z* \< 1.15)

b\) *P*(*z* \> 0.78)

c\) *P*(*z* \< 3.10)

<!-- -->

## Question 4

A high school wants to estimate the average number of hours per week
their students spend playing sports. They randomly select a sample
of 25 students and record the number of hours each student spends
playing sports. The sample has a mean of 4.5 hours per week with a
standard deviation of 1.1 hours per week. Considering a normal
distribution, construct a 90% confidence interval for the mean
number of hours per week that the students at the high school spend
playing sports.

<!-- -->

a\) Find the margin of error [2 marks]

b\) Find the confidence interval for the population mean [2 marks]

## Question 5

A software development team is assessing the performance of a new
feature in a software application. They collected data from a sample
of 35 users and recorded the time (in seconds) it took for each user
to complete a specific task. The sample mean completion time was 25
seconds. It is known that the population standard deviation of
completion time is 3.2 seconds. Calculate a 99% confidence interval
for the true mean completion time of all users.

a\) Find the best point estimate for the population mean [1 mark]

b\) Find the critical value [1 mark]

c\) Find the margin of error (maximum error of estimate) [2 marks]

d\) Find the confidence interval [2 mark]
