# Confidence intervals

## Question 2

Average score obtained by 25 students in a test is 75. It is known that
the standard deviation of the population of scores is 8. Find the
confidence interval at 95% confidence level, assuming the scores are
normally distributed.

$$ \text{CI} = \bar{x} \pm Z_{\alpha/2} \left( \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \right) $$

- $\bar{x} = 75$
- $\sigma = 8$
- $n = 25$
- $1-\alpha= 95\\%$

$$ \text{ME} = Z_{\alpha/2} \left( \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \right) $$
$$ \text{ME} = 1.96 \left( \frac{8}{\sqrt{25}} \right) $$
$$ \text{ME} = 1.96 \left( \frac{8}{5} \right) $$
$$ \text{ME} = 1.96 \times 1.6 $$

$$ \text{ME} = 3.136 $$

$$ \text{CI} = 75 \pm 3.136 $$
$$ \text{CI} = (75 - 3.136, 75 + 3.136) $$
$$ \text{CI} = (71.864, 78.136) $$

## Question 2 â€“ modified

Average score obtained by 25 students in a test is 75. The standard
deviation for the sample of scores is 8. Find the confidence interval at
95% confidence level, assuming the scores are normally distributed.

To find the confidence interval for the mean score of the students' test, given that the scores are normally distributed and the standard deviation is for the sample, we will use the t-distribution because the sample size is relatively small (n < 30).

The formula for the confidence interval of the mean when the sample standard deviation is known is:

$$ \text{CI} = \bar{x} \pm t_{\alpha/2} \left( \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \right) $$

Where:
- $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean
- $t_{\alpha/2}$ is the t-score corresponding to the desired confidence level and degrees of freedom
- $s$ is the sample standard deviation
- $n$ is the sample size

Given:
- $\bar{x} = 75$
- $s = 8$
- $n = 25$
- Confidence level = 95%

For a 95% confidence level and $n - 1 = 24$ degrees of freedom, $t_{\alpha/2}$ is approximately 2.064 (from t-distribution tables or using a t-distribution calculator).

Now, we can calculate the margin of error (ME):

$$ \text{ME} = t_{\alpha/2} \left( \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \right) $$
$$ \text{ME} = 2.064 \left( \frac{8}{\sqrt{25}} \right) $$
$$ \text{ME} = 2.064 \left( \frac{8}{5} \right) $$
$$ \text{ME} = 2.064 \times 1.6 $$

$$ \text{ME} = 3.3024 $$

Therefore, the confidence interval is:

$$ \text{CI} = 75 \pm 3.3024 $$
$$ \text{CI} = (75 - 3.3024, 75 + 3.3024) $$
$$ \text{CI} = (71.6976, 78.3024) $$

So, the 95% confidence interval for the average score is $(71.6976, 78.3024)$.

## Question 3

21 employees from a certain company travel to work an average of 14.3
miles. The standard deviation of their travel time was 2 miles. Find the
95% confidence interval of the true mean of the population, considering
the data is normally distributed.

To find the 95% confidence interval for the true mean of the population's travel distance, given that the data is normally distributed and the standard deviation is for the sample, we will use the t-distribution.

The formula for the confidence interval of the mean when the sample standard deviation is known is:

$$ \text{CI} = \bar{x} \pm t_{\alpha/2} \left( \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \right) $$

Where:
- $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean
- $t_{\alpha/2}$ is the t-score corresponding to the desired confidence level and degrees of freedom
- $s$ is the sample standard deviation
- $n$ is the sample size

Given:
- $\bar{x} = 14.3$ miles
- $s = 2$ miles
- $n = 21$
- Confidence level = 95%

For a 95% confidence level and $n - 1 = 20$ degrees of freedom, $t_{\alpha/2}$ is approximately 2.086 (from t-distribution tables or using a t-distribution calculator).

Now, we can calculate the margin of error (ME):

$$ \text{ME} = t_{\alpha/2} \left( \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}} \right) $$
$$ \text{ME} = 2.086 \left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{21}} \right) $$
$$ \text{ME} = 2.086 \left( \frac{2}{4.5826} \right) $$
$$ \text{ME} = 2.086 \times 0.436 $$

$$ \text{ME} = 0.910 $$

Therefore, the confidence interval is:

$$ \text{CI} = 14.3 \pm 0.910 $$
$$ \text{CI} = (14.3 - 0.910, 14.3 + 0.910) $$
$$ \text{CI} = (13.39, 15.21) $$

So, the 95% confidence interval for the average travel distance is $(13.39, 15.21)$ miles.

## Question 4

The average yearly income for 17 engineering graduates in 2008 was
$56,718. The standard deviation for the population of incomes is known
to be $650. Find the 90% confidence interval for the population mean,
considering the population is normally distributed.

To find the 90% confidence interval for the population mean, you can use the formula for the confidence interval when the population standard deviation is known. The formula is:

\[ \bar{x} \pm Z_{\alpha/2} \left( \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \right) \]

Where:
- \(\bar{x}\) is the sample mean.
- \(Z_{\alpha/2}\) is the critical value from the standard normal distribution for the desired confidence level.
- \(\sigma\) is the population standard deviation.
- \(n\) is the sample size.

Given:
- Sample mean (\(\bar{x}\)) = $56,718
- Population standard deviation (\(\sigma\)) = $650
- Sample size (\(n\)) = 17
- Confidence level = 90%

First, find the critical value \(Z_{\alpha/2}\) for a 90% confidence level. For a 90% confidence level, \(\alpha = 0.10\), so \(\alpha/2 = 0.05\). The critical value \(Z_{\alpha/2}\) corresponding to 0.05 in the standard normal distribution is approximately 1.645.

Now, calculate the margin of error:

\[ \text{Margin of error} = Z_{\alpha/2} \left( \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \right) \]

\[ \text{Margin of error} = 1.645 \left( \frac{650}{\sqrt{17}} \right) \]

\[ \text{Margin of error} = 1.645 \left( \frac{650}{4.123} \right) \]

\[ \text{Margin of error} = 1.645 \left( 157.59 \right) \]

\[ \text{Margin of error} \approx 259.98 \]

Now, calculate the confidence interval:

\[ \text{Lower limit} = \bar{x} - \text{Margin of error} \]

\[ \text{Lower limit} = 56,718 - 259.98 \]

\[ \text{Lower limit} \approx 56,458 \]

\[ \text{Upper limit} = \bar{x} + \text{Margin of error} \]

\[ \text{Upper limit} = 56,718 + 259.98 \]

\[ \text{Upper limit} \approx 56,978 \]

Therefore, the 90% confidence interval for the population mean is approximately:

\[ (56,458, 56,978) \]
