# Hypotheses Testing

## Steps for Hypotheses Testing

In a court of law, there are 2 possible errors:
1. Finding the defendant guilty when he is innocent.
2. Finding the defendant innocent when he is guilty.

In hypothesis testing, these 2 types of errors translate as follows:

1. **Type I error**: The mistake of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. For instance, in the above example, rejecting the hypothesis of mean salary being \$45,000 when, in fact, it is true.
2. **Type II error**: The mistake of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false. For instance, in the above example, failing to reject the hypothesis of mean salary being \$45,000 when, in reality, it is not true.

#### Type I and II Errors:

The size of \( \alpha \), the rejection region, affects the risk of making different types of incorrect decisions.

- **Type I Error**:
  - Rejecting a true null hypothesis when it should NOT be rejected.
  - Considered a serious type of error.
  - The probability of Type I Error is \( \alpha \).
  - It is also called the level of significance of the test.

- **Type II Error**:
  - Failing to reject a false null hypothesis that should have been rejected.
  - The probability of Type II Error is \( \beta \).

## Steps for Hypothesis Testing

### Identify the Null Hypothesis \(H_0\) and the Alternate Hypothesis \(H_1\)

1. Identify the null hypothesis \(H_0\) and the alternate hypothesis \(H_1\). As a rule, the null hypothesis will contain an equal sign, and the alternate hypothesis will contradict the null hypothesis (thus containing one of the inequality signs).

### Errors in Hypothesis Testing

In a court of law, there are 2 possible errors:
- (a) Finding the defendant guilty when he is innocent.
- (b) Finding the defendant innocent when he is guilty.

In hypothesis testing, these 2 types of errors translate as follows:
- **Type I Error**: The mistake of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. For instance, in the above example, rejecting the hypothesis of mean salary being \$45,000 when, in fact, it is true.
- **Type II Error**: The mistake of failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false. For instance, in the above example, failing to reject the hypothesis of mean salary being \$45,000 when, in reality, it is not true.

### Type I and II Errors

- **Type I Error**: Rejecting a true null hypothesis when it should NOT be rejected. This is considered a serious type of error. The probability of Type I Error is \(\alpha\). It is also called the level of significance of the test.
- **Type II Error**: Failing to reject a false null hypothesis that should have been rejected. The probability of Type II Error is \(\beta\).

2. Choose the level of significance \(\alpha\). The value should be small, usually less than 10%. Consider the consequences of both types of errors. Determine the critical region by calculating the critical value(s). There are 3 possibilities for the acceptance region:
   - If the test statistic is situated inside the acceptance region, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
   - If the test statistic is situated in the critical region, we reject the null hypothesis.

3. Choose the test statistic and calculate its value. For known \(\sigma\), calculate the z-score for the test statistic; for unknown \(\sigma\), calculate the t-score.

### Test of Hypothesis for the Mean

- **When \(\sigma\) is known**: The test statistic is \( z = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}} \).
- **When \(\sigma\) is unknown**: The test statistic is \( t = \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{s / \sqrt{n}} \).

### Steps - Continued

4. Compare the observed value of the statistic to the critical value obtained for the chosen level of significance and make a decision. Make a decision to reject/fail to reject the null hypothesis. Compare the z-score of the test statistic to the values of z that constructed the critical region. If the z-score of the test statistic falls in the critical region, we reject the null hypothesis. If it falls inside the acceptance zone, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

5. State a conclusion.
