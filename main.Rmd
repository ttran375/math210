## Question 2

Average score obtained by 25 students in a test is 75. It is known that
the standard deviation of the population of scores is 8. Find the
confidence interval at 95% confidence level, assuming the scores are
normally distributed.

To find the confidence interval for the mean score of the students' test, given that the scores are normally distributed, we can use the formula for the confidence interval of the mean when the population standard deviation is known:

$$ \text{CI} = \bar{x} \pm Z_{\alpha/2} \left( \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \right) $$

Where:
- $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean
- $Z_{\alpha/2}$ is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level
- $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation
- $n$ is the sample size

Given:
- $\bar{x} = 75$
- $\sigma = 8$
- $n = 25$
- Confidence level = 95%

For a 95% confidence level, $Z_{\alpha/2}$ is approximately 1.96.

Now, we can calculate the margin of error (ME):

$$ \text{ME} = Z_{\alpha/2} \left( \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \right) $$
$$ \text{ME} = 1.96 \left( \frac{8}{\sqrt{25}} \right) $$
$$ \text{ME} = 1.96 \left( \frac{8}{5} \right) $$
$$ \text{ME} = 1.96 \times 1.6 $$
$$ \text{ME} = 3.136 $$

Therefore, the confidence interval is:

$$ \text{CI} = 75 \pm 3.136 $$
$$ \text{CI} = (75 - 3.136, 75 + 3.136) $$
$$ \text{CI} = (71.864, 78.136) $$

So, the 95% confidence interval for the average score is $(71.864, 78.136)$.
