# Hypotheses testing for a population proportion

## Question 1

In a study of air-bags effectiveness, it was found that in 821 crashes of
midsize cars equipped with air bags, 46 of the crashes resulted in
hospitalization of the drivers. Use a 0.01 significance level to test the
claim that the air bag hospitalization rate is lower than 7.8% rate for
crashes of midsize cars equipped with automatic safety belts but no air
bags.
