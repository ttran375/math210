# Hypotheses testing for a population proportion

## Example

In a study of air-bags effectiveness, it was found that in 821 crashes of
midsize cars equipped with air bags, 46 of the crashes resulted in
hospitalization of the drivers. Use a 0.01 significance level to test the
claim that the air bag hospitalization rate is lower than 7.8% rate for
crashes of midsize cars equipped with automatic safety belts but no air
bags.

- $n = 821$
- $x = 46$
- $\alpha = 0.01$
- $p = 0.078$

### Step 1

- $H_0: p = 0.078$
- $H_1: p < 0.078$

### Step 2

$Z_{0.01} = -2.33$

### Step 3

$$ \hat{p} = \frac{46}{821} \approx 0.056 $$

$$ \text{SE} = \sqrt{\frac{p (1 - p)}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.078 \times (1 - 0.078)}{821}} \approx 0.0094 $$

$$ Z = \frac{\hat{p} - p}{\text{SE}} = \frac{0.056 - 0.078}{0.0092} \approx -2.35 $$

### Step 4

Since the P-value (0.0084) is less than the significance level (0.01), we reject the null hypothesis.

### Step 5

At 1% level of significance, there is enough evidence to support the claim.

## Question 1

According to a study, 84% of U.S. children ages 8 to 18 had Internet
access at home as of August 2009. Researchers wonder if this number
has increased since then. The original sample consisted of 500 children,
and 86% of them had Internet access at home. Test the researchersâ€™
claim at 5 % level of significance.

- $p = 0.84$
- $\hat{p} = 0.86$
- $x = 500$
- $\alpha = 0.05$, right tail test

### Step 1

- $H_0: p = 0.84$
- $H_1: p > 0.84$

### Step 2

- $\alpha = 0.05$
- $Z_{\alpha} = Z_{0.05} \approx 1.645$

### Step 3

$$ \hat{p} = \frac{0.86 \times 500}{500} = 0.86 $$

$$ \text{SE} = \sqrt{\frac{p_0 (1 - p_0)}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.84 \times (1 - 0.84)}{500}} \approx 0.016 $$

$$ Z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\text{SE}} = \frac{0.86 - 0.84}{0.016} \approx 1.22 $$

### Step 4

Fail to reject $H_0$ (Do not reject $H_0$)

### Step 5

At 5% level of significance, there is not enough evidence to support the claim.

## Question 2

Data from the Center for Disease Control estimates that about 30.4%
of American teenagers were overweight in 2008.

- A professor in public health at a major university wants to determine
whether the proportion has decreased since 2008. He samples 800
randomly selected incoming freshman at universities around the
country. Using the BMI measurements, he finds that 210 of them are
overweight.
- If the professor uses a significance level of 0.10, what conclusion can he
draw?

### Given Data

- $p_0 = 0.304$
- $n = 800$
- $x = 210$
- $\alpha = 0.10$
- $ \hat{p} = \frac{x}{n} = \frac{210}{800} = 0.2625 $

### Step 1

- $H_0: p = 0.304$
- $H_1: p < 0.304$

### Step 2

- $\alpha = 0.10$
- $Z_{\alpha} = Z_{0.10} \approx -1.28$

### Step 3

$$ \text{SE} = \sqrt{\frac{p_0 (1 - p_0)}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.304 \times (1 - 0.304)}{800}} \approx 0.0163 $$

$$ Z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\text{SE}} = \frac{0.2625 - 0.304}{0.0163} \approx -2.55 $$

### Step 4

Reject the null hypothesis $H_0$.

### Step 5

At the 10% level of significance, there is enough evidence to support the claim.

## Question 3

The NCHS report indicated that in 2002, 75% of children aged 2 to 17
saw a dentist in the past year. An investigator wants to assess whether
use of dental services is similar in children living in a certain city. A
sample of 125 children aged 2 to 17 living in that city are surveyed and
64 reported seeing a dentist over the past 12 months. Is there a
significant difference in use of dental services between children living in
that particular city and the national data?

## Hypotheses Testing for Population Proportion

### Given Data

- $p_0 = 0.75$
- $n = 125$
- $x = 64$
- $\alpha = 0.05$
- $\hat{p} = \frac{64}{125} \approx 0.512$

### Step 1

- $H_0: p = 0.75$
- $H_1: p \neq 0.75$

### Step 2

- $\alpha = 0.05$
- $Z_{\alpha/2} \approx \pm 1.96$

### Step 3

$$ \text{SE} = \sqrt{\frac{p_0 (1 - p_0)}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.75 \times (1 - 0.75)}{125}} \approx 0.0387 $$

$$ Z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\text{SE}} = \frac{0.512 - 0.75}{0.0387} \approx -6.15 $$

### Step 4

Reject the null hypothesis $H_0$.

### Step 5

- At the 5% level of significance, there is enough evidence to support the claim.

## Question 4

Ships arriving in ports in a certain country are inspected by Customs
officials for contaminated cargo. Assume, for a certain port, 20% of the
ships arriving in the previous year contained cargo that was
contaminated. A random selection of 50 ships in the current year
included 5 that had contaminated cargo. Does the data suggest that the
proportion of ships arriving in the port with contaminated cargoes has
decreased in the current year? Use $\alpha = 0.01$.

## Hypotheses Testing for Population Proportion

### Given Data

- $p_0 = 0.20$
- $n = 50$
- $x = 5$
- $\alpha = 0.01$
- $\hat{p} = \frac{5}{50} = 0.10$

### Step 1

- $H_0: p = 0.20$
- $H_1: p < 0.20$

### Step 2

- $\alpha = 0.01$
- $Z_{\alpha} = Z_{0.01} \approx -2.33$

### Step 3

$$ \text{SE} = \sqrt{\frac{p_0 (1 - p_0)}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.20 \times (1 - 0.20)}{50}} \approx 0.0566 $$

$$ Z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\text{SE}} = \frac{0.10 - 0.20}{0.0566} \approx -1.77 $$

### Step 4

Fail to reject $H_0$.

### Step 5

At the 1% level of significance, there is not enough evidence to support the claim.

## Question 5

Suppose that we want to test the hypothesis with a significance level of .05 that
the climate has changed since industrialization. Suppose that the mean temperature
throughout history is 50 degrees. During the last 40 years, the mean temperature
has been 51 degrees. Suppose the population standard deviation is 2 degrees and
that the population is normally distributed. What can we conclude?

a\) State the hypotheses

b\) State the level of significance and construct the critical interval

c\) Calculate the test statistics

d\) Make a decision

e\) State a conclusion

### a) State the hypotheses

- $H_0: \mu = 50$
- $H_1: \mu \neq 50$

### b) State the level of significance and construct the critical interval

- $\alpha = 0.05$
- $Z_{\alpha/2} = 1.96$

### c) Calculate the test statistics

Given data:

- $\mu_0 = 50$
- $\bar{x} = 51$
- $\sigma = 2$
- $n = 40$

$$ Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{51 - 50}{2/\sqrt{40}} \approx 3.16 $$

### d) Make a decision

Reject $H_0$.

### e) State a conclusion

At the 5% level of significance, there is enough evidence to support the claim.
