# Hypotheses testing for a population proportion

## Example

In a study of air-bags effectiveness, it was found that in 821 crashes of
midsize cars equipped with air bags, 46 of the crashes resulted in
hospitalization of the drivers. Use a 0.01 significance level to test the
claim that the air bag hospitalization rate is lower than 7.8% rate for
crashes of midsize cars equipped with automatic safety belts but no air
bags.

- $n = 821$
- $x = 46$
- $\alpha = 0.01$
- $p = 0.078$

### Step 1

- $H_0: p = 0.078$
- $H_1: p < 0.078$

### Step 2

$Z_{0.01} = -2.33$

### Step 3

$$ \hat{p} = \frac{46}{821} \approx 0.056 $$

$$ \text{SE} = \sqrt{\frac{p (1 - p)}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.078 \times (1 - 0.078)}{821}} \approx 0.0092 $$

$$ Z = \frac{\hat{p} - p}{\text{SE}} = \frac{0.056 - 0.078}{0.0092} \approx -2.35 $$

### Step 4

Since the P-value (0.0084) is less than the significance level (0.01), we reject the null hypothesis.

### Step 5: Compare the P-value with the Significance Level

At 1% level of significance, there is enough evidence to support the claim.

## Question 1

According to a study, 84% of U.S. children ages 8 to 18 had Internet
access at home as of August 2009. Researchers wonder if this number
has increased since then. The original sample consisted of 500 children,
and 86% of them had Internet access at home. Test the researchersâ€™
claim at 5 % level of significance.

- $p = 0.84$
- $\hat{p} = 0.86$
- $x = 500$
- $\alpha = 0.05$, right tail test

### Step 1: State the Hypotheses

- $H_0: p = 0.84$
- $H_1: p > 0.84$

### Step 2: Determine the Critical Value

- $\alpha = 0.05$
- $Z_{\alpha} = Z_{0.05} \approx 1.645$

### Step 3: Calculate the Test Statistic

$$ \hat{p} = \frac{0.86 \times 500}{500} = 0.86 $$

$$ \text{SE} = \sqrt{\frac{p_0 (1 - p_0)}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.84 \times (1 - 0.84)}{500}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.84 \times 0.16}{500}} \approx 0.016 $$

$$ Z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\text{SE}} = \frac{0.86 - 0.84}{0.016} \approx 1.22 $$

### Step 4: Make a Decision

Fail to reject $H_0$ (Do not reject $H_0$)

### Step 5: State the Conclusion

At 5% level of significance, there is not enough evidence to support the claim.

## Question 2

Data from the Center for Disease Control estimates that about 30.4%
of American teenagers were overweight in 2008.

- A professor in public health at a major university wants to determine
whether the proportion has decreased since 2008. He samples 800
randomly selected incoming freshman at universities around the
country. Using the BMI measurements, he finds that 210 of them are
overweight.
- If the professor uses a significance level of 0.10, what conclusion can he
draw?

### Given Data

- $p_0 = 0.304$
- $n = 800$
- $x = 210$
- $\alpha = 0.10$
- $ \hat{p} = \frac{x}{n} = \frac{210}{800} = 0.2625 $

### Step 1: State the Hypotheses

- $H_0: p = 0.304$
- $H_1: p < 0.304$

### Step 2: Determine the Critical Value

- $\alpha = 0.10$
- $Z_{\alpha} = Z_{0.10} \approx -1.28$

### Step 3: Calculate the Test Statistic

Calculate the sample proportion $\hat{p}$:



Calculate the standard error (SE):

$$ \text{SE} = \sqrt{\frac{p_0 (1 - p_0)}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.304 \times (1 - 0.304)}{800}} \approx 0.0163 $$

Calculate the test statistic $Z$:

$$ Z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\text{SE}} = \frac{0.2625 - 0.304}{0.0163} \approx -2.54 $$

### Step 4: Make a Decision

Compare the calculated Z value with the critical value:

- Calculated $Z \approx -2.54$
- Critical value $Z_{\alpha} \approx -1.28$

Since $Z \approx -2.54$ is less than $-1.28$, we reject the null hypothesis $H_0$.

### Step 5: State the Conclusion

At the 0.10 significance level, there is sufficient evidence to support the claim that the proportion of overweight American teenagers has decreased since 2008.
